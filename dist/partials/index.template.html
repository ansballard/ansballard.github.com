<h3 id=current-position>Current Position</h3><p>I&#39;ve been a frontend web developer at <a href=https://pdsenergy.com>PDS Energy</a> since 2014. I work on Javascript-driven sites using RESTful APIs, internal tools using NodeJS and Electron, as well as legacy sites using Classic ASP. I&#39;ve put together the build system we use on a majority of our sites, helped develop major features for multiple sites, and always strived to stay on the edge of new and useful web tech.</p><h3 id=background>Background</h3><p>I have a Bachelor&#39;s in Computer Science from <a href=https://moreheadstate.edu>Morehead State University</a>, where I studied for 4 years. Immediately after graduation, my wife and I moved to Austin, TX, where we both found jobs in our respective fields. Since then I&#39;ve continued to dive into the latest in web development, whether it be hackathons, meetups, podcasts, blogs, newsletters, etc.</p><h3 id=about-me>About Me</h3><p>A lot of my time is split between my wife and my dog. But I also like to walk local trails, work at coffee shops, play computer games, and travel. The most fun I&#39;ve had in a long time was a recent road trip to the Grand Canyon with my wife. As much as I love my laptop and websites, it&#39;s nice to be able to take some time to escape and be with other people (and dogs).</p>
