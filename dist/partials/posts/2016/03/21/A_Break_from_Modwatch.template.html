<h1 id=a-break-from-modwatch>A Break from Modwatch</h1><h3 id=life-gets-busy-sometimes>Life gets busy sometimes</h3><p>One of the most popular things I&#39;ve ever made is <a href=http://modwat.ch>Modwatch</a>. There are probably more people using it than most of the pages I make at my day job. Not that my day job is <em>especially</em> exciting, but that&#39;s still pretty cool. When I made the first version of the site, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I&#39;ve only been making websites with any amount of skill for a couple years, and Modwatch is a couple years old. And every time I learn a better way to do something, or find a new tool that I love, I have to do a <strong>serious</strong> refactor to work it into Modwatch. So over time I&#39;ve slacked, and not rebuilt it from the ground up every few months, and now I barely recognize the code running it.</p><p>Around that time, I got offered a spot on a team of <strong>amazing</strong> devs to work on a new modding-related project. It seemed like a crazy idea, and I thought it would be fun to try to learn some new things. But suddenly life started getting hectic. I bit off a little more than I could chew in more than a couple aspects of my life, and it really took a toll on me. So I pulled away from all my different projects without any warning (sorry about that) and hid in my little work/family bubble, and tried to get myself a little more put together. But it turns out grinding away at work and only talking to one or two people for a couple months isn&#39;t very good for you either. Who knew?</p><h3 id=resurfacing>Resurfacing</h3><p>I&#39;m still <em>pretty</em> busy, both at work and at home, but I&#39;ve actually just finished one of the bigger projects I had going on. So I&#39;m going to try to get back into a few things I was doing before. One of those was <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods>/r/skyrimmods</a>, which was a pretty big piece of my free time for quite a while. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have much time for a little while to do anything major, but I <em>may</em> try to go back through some messages and fix a few bugs here and there. It was always so nice to check in and see all the people that I could positively affect. Even if all that meant was fixing missing textures or a broken quest.</p><p>Like I said, this doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll see me commenting <em>every day</em> after work, but I&#39;m going to make an effort to get back into the scene, little by little. And I&#39;m going to try to write here at <strong>least</strong> once a week, so if you enjoy my rambling to the point that you can stand it one out of seven days, feel free to check back <a href=/#/posts>here</a> for new posts. And if you notice me slacking, feel free to <a href=https://twitter.com/ansballard>tweet at me</a> and tell me to write something!</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>Aaron, aka Peanut</p>
