# Taco Time

![Tacos][tacos]

I love tacos. They're always delicious, I can throw basically anything food-like into them, and it uses up some of the leftovers we always have. The only effort I put in is to cook the tortillas in a skillet to get them nice and fancy looking. Then I get to hand a plate to Catherine and pretend I worked super hard on them. It's great.

# Gotta Walk the Dog

I've been putting some serious miles on the trails outside my neighborhood lately. Pokemon Go says I've covered 49.1km since 7/8/2016, and it tends to underestimate. I have no shame in the fact that I've been destroying Tabby with 2-3 mile walks in 100 degree heat. I've been bringing 2 full nalgenes worth of water and she downs them both before collapsing in some poor person's yard. But I think she knows that's the price she pays to catch em all.
