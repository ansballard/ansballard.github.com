# A Break from Modwatch
### Life gets busy sometimes

One of the most popular things I've ever made is [Modwatch](http://modwat.ch). There are probably more people using it than most of the pages I make at my day job. Not that my day job is *especially* exciting, but that's still pretty cool. When I made the first version of the site, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I've only been making websites with any amount of skill for a couple years, and Modwatch is a couple years old. And every time I learn a better way to do something, or find a new tool that I love, I have to do a **serious** refactor to work it into Modwatch. So over time I've slacked, and not rebuilt it from the ground up every few months, and now I barely recognize the code running it.

Around that time, I got offered a spot on a team of **amazing** devs to work on a new modding-related project. It seemed like a crazy idea, and I thought it would be fun to try to learn some new things. But suddenly life started getting hectic. I bit off a little more than I could chew in more than a couple aspects of my life, and it really took a toll on me. So I pulled away from all my different projects without any warning (sorry about that) and hid in my little work/family bubble, and tried to get myself a little more put together. But it turns out grinding away at work and only talking to one or two people for a couple months isn't very good for you either. Who knew?

### Resurfacing

I'm still *pretty* busy, both at work and at home, but I've actually just finished one of the bigger projects I had going on. So I'm going to try to get back into a few things I was doing before. One of those was [/r/skyrimmods](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods), which was a pretty big piece of my free time for quite a while. I don't think I'll have much time for a little while to do anything major, but I *may* try to go back through some messages and fix a few bugs here and there. It was always so nice to check in and see all the people that I could positively affect. Even if all that meant was fixing missing textures or a broken quest.

Like I said, this doesn't mean you'll see me commenting *every day* after work, but I'm going to make an effort to get back into the scene, little by little. And I'm going to try to write here at **least** once a week, so if you enjoy my rambling to the point that you can stand it one out of seven days, feel free to check back [here](/#/posts) for new posts. And if you notice me slacking, feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/ansballard) and tell me to write something!

Thanks for reading!
