### Current Position
I've been a frontend web developer at [PDS Energy](https://pdsenergy.com) since 2014. Most of my work involves creating modern web applications with Angular, jQuery, or vanilla Javascript. Most projects require some amount of backend work as well, which is either in Classic ASP, C# .NET, or occasionally NodeJS. I've also written multiple developer utilities using Node, specifically Electron for desktop apps.

### Current Interests
I've spent a lot of time perfecting my development workflow. At the moment I'm nailing down the file structure and build scripts for multiplatform Angular apps, based on the [John Papa Styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) and using ES6 modules transpiled with browserify. You can find an example at my [electron-base](https://github.com/ansballard/electron-base) repo.

### Background

I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Morehead State University](https://moreheadstate.edu), where I studied for 4 years. Immediately after graduation, my wife and I moved to Austin, TX. After several months of job searching, we were both hired in our respective fields, and have been working ever since.
